Hi John,

Your CSV request has finished processing. We’re always here to help. The district file is uploaded to Amazon Web Services, so you’ll be able to download the CSV file from there at your convenience. The download link will expire after a week. Due to the size of certain districts, using a data processing system like Microsoft Excel might not work.

If you are looking for a place to store and work with your new data, keep in mind that you can try NationBuilder, free for 14-days:

Additionally, if you would like us to import the data directly into your new nation once you start just let us know and we can fast-track the process by importing the data directly into your nation.

You’ll notice there are two files in the zip: the main voter file, and a file containing the voting history for these voters. You can use it in conjunction with your main file to target voters by the frequency in which they turn-out. The two files share one ID in between them, ‘state_file_id’.

Please note that each voter appears in the voting history file as many times as they voted. If you need more information on the fields included in your vote history, please go to: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__nationbuilder.com_import-5Fvote-5Fhistory-23fields&d=DwIFaQ&c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&r=adp0F8Sb9KPBM0x467PWK96YoSCWFd1smdWzoZbadSM&m=BMGnLR9IaI4cm1RFuvMytARagA0OPBZms2zQPSDFlsM&s=jbFdzRRpFmMtXngXq7bLQlefVgvj1sSx66o2LFBfIdk&e=.
